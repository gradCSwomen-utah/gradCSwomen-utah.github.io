bio: "I am Syeda Mishra Saiara, a final year masterâ€™s student working with Prof. Guanhong Tao. My interests and passions surround in cybersecurity, mostly in LLM/ML vulnerabilities also focusing on preserving data privacy in these ecosystems. I come from a small, yet vibrant South Asian country named Bangladesh. Being a Bangladeshi, I bring diversities in culture, foods, and life visions. I am a nature person, who loves mountains and hiking as well, making Utah a lot closer to my heart!"
