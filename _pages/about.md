## About Us 
Let's be honest. Graduate school is hard. What do you do when your paper is rejected? How do you battle those resurfacing feelings of imposter syndrome? How do you establish a work-life balance while churning out research results? 

Grad-CS Women is an inclusive community that aims to equip computer science graduate students at the University of Utah with the survival skills to succeed in their degree programs. As a student-led organization based in the Kahlert School of Computing, we are committed to creating a supportive environment where graduate students can thrive academically, professionally, and socially. We welcome ***all*** computer science graduate students across various departments. You **do not** have to be a female-identifying student to join the organization. The Grad-CS Women body consists of students of various identities, backgrounds, and areas of expertise, such as computer vision, machine learning, medical image analysis, supercomputing, etc.

Success in graduate school requires careful insight and experience, often not inherent to even senior graduate students. Grad-CS Women helps guide students through their graduate journey from the ground up so that what can be a confusing process becomes simple and clear. Whether you are a first-year or senior graduate student, Grad-CS Women can impart valuable lessons to support your unique graduate experience.
