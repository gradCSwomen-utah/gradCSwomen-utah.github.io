## Officer Positions 
Serving as an officer on the Grad-CS Women leadership team is a great way to develop strong leadership skills that translate into research and the workplace. Not to mention, it's a solid resume booster! 

Elections to determine officer positions are held annually in July. Officers are chosen through a voting process conducted by the entire Grad-CS Women body. To run for a position, an applicant must substantiate

1. consistent involvement in Grad-CS Women meetings and organizational events
2. strong prior leadership experiences appropriate for the applied position
3. adeptness in working in team environments

You **do not** have to be a female-identifying student to run for a position. We offer applications to interested members we have gotten to know well over the months. There is no online application.
