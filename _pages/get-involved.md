## The Perks of Joining
As a member of Grad-CS Women, you’ll have access to:
- Department-specific social gatherings
- Volunteering and outreach opportunities
- Coding/Hackathon preparation workshops
- Career-building workshops (e.g., resume/LinkedIn creation, interview preparation, etc.)
- Research workshops (e.g., paper/poster design, conference preparation, etc.)
- Scholarship and fellowship workshops (e.g., finding grants, applying to GRFP, etc.)
- Soft skills development workshops (e.g., presentation, communication, networking, etc.)

and much more. Please note that while Grad-CS Women was designed to support female computer science graduate students, we welcome all computer science graduate students **(including non-female students)** who support the women in tech initiative. We regularly send event reminders to the entire CS graduate community via the <span style="color: orange;">grads@cs.utah.edu</span> mailing list.

Additionally, if you are a female CS graduate alumni and would like to serve as a mentor in the Grad-CS Women mentorship program or give a guest talk for the group, please get in touch with us.
