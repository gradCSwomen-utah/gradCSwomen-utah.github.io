#With the flowers blooming in their full beauty and the torrid sun high in the sky, it is shocking to think that the start of Fall semester is only a month away. #Although the start of classes is fast approaching, so is the first Grad-CS Women social event of the year!

#Grad-CS Women social events are among the many highlights of the graduate computer science community at the Kahlert School of Computing. It's a great space for #students to connect and gives first-years a gentle introduction to graduate life. ALL computer science graduate students, regardless of female identity, are #welcome. 

#Grad-CS Women will host the first Social and Networking Mixer of the academic year on September _________, 2024 from ____ PM to _____ PM. Food and drinks will be #provided. Join us for fun, great food, and new connections!
