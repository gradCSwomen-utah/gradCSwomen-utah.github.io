With the flowers blooming in their full beauty and the torrid sun high in the sky, it is shocking to think that the start of Fall semester is only a month away. Although the start of classes is fast approaching, many changes are coming to the Kahlert School of Computing, including a new organization designed to support female computer science graduate students: Grad-CS Women! 

The officer team of Grad-CS Women for the 2024-2025 academic year consists of seven highly motivated female computer science (2 MS and 5 PhD) students with strong leadership backgrounds. Under the guidance of Assistant Professor Anna Fariha, the team of women will strengthen the current female computer science community, host technical workshops, and spearhead an alum mentorship program. 

Grad-CS Women will debut with a welcome presentation at the new graduate student orientation on August 14th, 2024. Formal events will occur bi-monthly starting in September.
