Moving to the USA at the age of 16 for college was a significant milestone in my life. Originally from Belarus, I embarked on this journey to pursue higher education and tennis. I started my academic career at Lamar University and later transferred to the University of Northern Colorado (UNC), where I played as a Division 1 student-athlete. My time at UNC was not only filled with athletic accomplishments but also academic achievements. I graduated with a BS in mathematics and served as the vice-president of the mathematics club, honing my leadership and organizational skills.

My journey has evolved as a third-year PhD student at the University of Utah. The transition from applied mathematics to computer science has been both challenging and rewarding. My work in the lab involves researching complex algorithms and developing innovative solutions to real-world problems. The collaborative environment and access to cutting-edge resources at the University of Utah have been instrumental in my growth as a researcher.

My Work in the Lab
In my current role, I focus on developing algorithms that address efficiency and optimization in computational systems. This involves a lot of coding, testing, and refining to ensure that the solutions we develop are robust and scalable. My lab is a hub of innovation, where we constantly push the boundaries of what is possible in computer science. Collaborating with peers and mentors who are equally passionate about research has been one of the most enriching aspects of my PhD journey.

Overall, my experience at the University of Utah has been a blend of rigorous academic challenges and exciting research opportunities. I am grateful for the support and encouragement from my peers, mentors, and the wider academic community, which has made this journey incredibly fulfilling.
