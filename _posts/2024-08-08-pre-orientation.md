As the summer days gradually give way to cooler autumn breezes, we are thrilled to welcome our new and returning students to the Fall Semester! This time of year is always special, filled with fresh beginnings and endless possibilities. We can’t wait to embark on this journey with you and support you every step of the way.

Orientation is more than just an introduction to campus; it's your first taste of the vibrant community and academic life that awaits. Whether you’re new to our institution or returning after a break, this is the perfect opportunity to explore the myriad of resources and opportunities available to you.

During orientation, you’ll have the chance to meet fellow students, connect with faculty and staff, and get acquainted with the many services and support systems designed to help you succeed. From campus tours and informational sessions to social events and networking opportunities, there’s something for everyone.

We encourage you to take full advantage of these activities. Ask questions, make new friends, and immerse yourself in the welcoming atmosphere that defines our community. Your journey is just beginning, and we are here to ensure you have all the tools and support you need to make this semester a successful and memorable one. As a part of Grad-Women-CS, all of our administrative team will be scattered throughtout orientation activities. Feel free to talk to us and ask questions! We are beyond excited to have new people join this amazing new cohort. Find more information about who to contact in our 'People' tab. 

Here’s to a fantastic Fall Semester filled with learning, growth, and exciting experiences. We look forward to seeing you at orientation and throughout the year. Welcome to a new chapter—let’s make it extraordinary together!
