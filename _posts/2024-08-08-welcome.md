Summer has flown by in the blink of an eye, and as the crisp fall winds begin to weave their way through Salt Lake City's evenings, the start of a new semester is just around the corner. Fall semesters always carry a bittersweet charm. They usher in a wave of fresh faces on campus, brimming with excitement and determination to embark on their journey at the U. At the same time, we look forward to the enchanting transformation of our campus with vibrant autumn leaves and the blanket of snow that covers the pavements.

This fall, a special sense of sweetness outweighs the usual mix of anticipation and stress. As an officer of the Grad-Women-CS community, I am more thrilled than ever to join this remarkable group of talented and diverse individuals. On behalf of the Grad-Women-CS community, we are excited to meet everyone at orientation and kick off this semester enthusiastically and positively!
