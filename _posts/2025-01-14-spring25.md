Hello everyone, and welcome to the Spring 2025 semester! As we kick off another exciting term, we're thrilled to continue growing and learning together as part of our Grad-CS-Women club. We can't wait to see all the amazing things we'll accomplish this semester and the new connections we’ll build along the way.

This semester, we’re gearing up for a series of fun and informative events that will help you expand your knowledge, grow your network, and get involved in the CS community. Whether you’re new to the club or a returning member, we hope you’re just as excited as we are for what’s to come!

Keep an eye on our website for the latest updates on upcoming events, workshops, guest speakers, and social gatherings. We want to create a space where you can collaborate, learn from one another, and be part of an inclusive, inspiring environment.

Let’s make Spring 2025 a semester to remember. We’re looking forward to seeing you all soon!
