Grad-CS Women is a new organization starting at the University of Utah in Fall 2024 to provide a supportive community for female-identifying computer science graduate students enrolled in the Kahlert School of Computing. The organization will arrange social events, lectures, and other professional activities such as career-building and research workshops.
